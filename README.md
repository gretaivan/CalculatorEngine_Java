# Calculator Engine in Java
project built to implement the java theory. 
### Features: 
+ Arrays 
+ Loops 
+ Conditional statements
+ Command line argument handling
+ Strings - <em> good to know that if there is frequent String compatison, the method intern() can be used to assign the pointer to the already existing string that allows == and reduces the overhead. But it should only be used when there is a lot of equality checks </em><br>
```s1 = "Hello";  s2 = "hello";   s3 = s1.intern();  s4 = s2.intern();``` <br>  ```s3 == s5; //true```
